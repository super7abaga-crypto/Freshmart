# Freshmart

**Fatoke Market**: a grocery delivery demo. A Python (FastAPI) app that renders its own pages (Jinja2 + HTMX), with TypeScript for the cart and checkout, in one repository.

```

## Quick start

You need Python 3.11 or newer, and Node 20+ only if you change the TypeScript.

```bash
make setup     # create apps/api/.venv, install Python and TypeScript dependencies
make dev       # http://localhost:4000 (API and storefront together)
make test      # run the test suite
make lint      # check Python style and type-check the TypeScript (make format to fix)
make build-web # recompile TypeScript after editing apps/web/src (commit the result)
```

Run `make help` for the full list. With no `DATABASE_URL` set, data is kept in a local JSON file (`apps/api/data/db.json`). Set `DATABASE_URL` to use Postgres.

## What is real and what is simulated

| Real | Simulated |
| --- | --- |
| Accounts with hashed passwords and httpOnly session cookies | Card, bank transfer and USSD payments (no money moves) |
| Orders saved server-side with prices recalculated from the server catalog | The "SMS to store" message (logged and shown in a staff-only inbox) |
| Staff-only store inbox protected by a staff key | |

To make payments real, integrate Paystack or Flutterwave. To make SMS real, use Termii or Africa's Talking. Both must be called from the API, never from the browser.
