## Setup

```bash
make setup
make dev
```

## Before opening a pull request

```bash
make lint
make test
```

CI runs the same checks on every pull request that touches `apps/`.

## Conventions

- **Backend**: Python 3.11, formatted and linted by Ruff (`make format`). Read environment variables only in `apps/api/app/config.py`.
- **Database changes**: add the function to both `db_file.py` and `db_postgres.py`, and expose it through `db.py`, so routes never depend on a specific store.
- **Prices and totals** are computed on the server only. Never trust a price sent by the browser.
- **Pages and forms**: render them with Jinja2 templates in `apps/api/app/templates`. Do not build HTML by string concatenation.
- **TypeScript** (`apps/web/src`): create elements with `h()` and `textContent`, never `innerHTML`. After editing, run `make build-web` and commit `apps/web/static/js/main.js`. CI fails if it is stale.
- **Tests**: add or update a test in `apps/api/tests/` for any API behaviour you change.
- **Secrets** never go in the repository. Use environment variables (see `apps/api/.env.example`).

## Pull requests

Keep them focused, describe what changed and how you tested it, and wait for review before merging.
